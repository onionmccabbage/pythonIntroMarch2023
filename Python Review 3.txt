Python Review Exercise 3
========================

We need to read in some 'todos' data (available as text in JSON format)
Then separate the 'completed' tasks and write them to a log file along with a record of the date and time 

Consider architecture, such as separating your code into packages and modules

Details
=======
A collection of 'todos' data is provided as a text file (containing JSON)
Use a file access object to open and read in all the JSON (careful with file locations)
Import pythons 'json' library and use it to convert the raw JSON into a python structure
  struct = json.load(<data>) 
Iterate over the structure and for each completed task, write that task to a text file
Also write the date and time into the text file

Consider how you could write a custom generator to yield a nicely formatted date-time value 
You could use your date-time generator to supply the date-time top be written into the text file
Remember to wrap any file access code within try-except
Also dont forget to close your file access object (or use 'with')

Optional
========
Also write the incompleted tasks to a different text file (along with the date and time)
Overwrite the original JSON data file so it only contains the incomplete todos (in JSON format)
Compare writing the same data as a byte file and as a text file
If you wish, you could use 'requests' to access 200 todos here:
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
Then you could separate them into text files for each of the ten different userIDs
